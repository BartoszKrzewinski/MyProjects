# Hello world!  
  
## About me

### My name is **Bartosz Krzewinski.**

I'm a manager by education. I was fulfilling myself in this role for over nine years. However, I've always been interested in IT.   I want to change my industry to look for a better work-life balance. Besides, I want to do something that I will be able to fulfill until retirement.   I'm focusing on testing because it has always been easy for me to detect errors in the software, whether at work or home. Unfortunately, I couldn't always do something with this knowledge. In the future, I would like to use my managerial experience to become a test manager. In my work as a tester, my deeply instilled feedback culture, teamwork abilities, and high interpersonal skills will certainly help me.

My main hobbies are:  
Music - unpopular  
Movies - B-horror movies from the VHS era  
Literature of moral anxiety  
Multiplayer games (participating in the beta tests of World of Warcraft)  
Cycling
